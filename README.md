# Monad Poker
Fair, realâ€time Texas Holdâ€em on the Monad blockchain.

- Pyth Entropy = provably fair shuffles (no one can rig the deck)
- Multisynq = smooth, synced multiplayer tables
- Monad Embedded Wallet (Privy) + Monad Games ID = simple, oneâ€tap approvals

## What makes it fair?
- Pyth Entropy is like a neutral referee flipping a coin in public.
- Every shuffle is requested on the blockchain and returned as a verifiable result.
- No secret servers. No hidden code. Anyone can audit the deal later.

## How a hand works (in plain English)
1. The host clicks â€Start Game.â€
2. The game asks the blockchain for a shuffle (small network fee).
3. Youâ€ll see a wallet popâ€up to approve. Tap â€Approve.â€
4. A few seconds later, the deck arrives from Pyth Entropy.
5. Cards are dealt. Play your hand like normal poker.
6. Winners are recorded and the leaderboard updates.

## Multiplayer, kept in sync
- Everyone at the table sees the same thing at the same time.
- One browser tab acts as the â€table dealerâ€ to keep the game flowing (automatic, no advantage).
- If that tab closes, another takes overâ€no downtime.

## Your wallet, made simple
- Log in with Privy (email or wallet). If you donâ€t have a wallet, one is created for you.
- The wallet lives in your browserâ€your keys stay with you.
- Monad Games ID helps your identity and wallet work across other Monad games that support it.
- You approve any onâ€chain action with a familiar popâ€up.

## Why this matters
- Transparent: Every shuffle and result is onâ€chain and traceable.
- Trustless: The randomness comes from a public source (Pyth), not us.
- Easy: Login is simple, approvals are one tap, and gameplay feels like a normal online poker table.

## Quick start
- Open the app link.
- Log in (email or wallet).
- Create or join a table with friends.
- Host starts the first hand and approves the shuffle popâ€up.

## Costs

- Shuffles require a small network fee (covered by your testnet wallet balance).

## FAQ
- â€Onâ€chainâ€? The gameâ€s key moments (like shuffles) are recorded on a public ledger.
- â€Randomnessâ€? Pyth Entropy is a public randomness serviceâ€think: unbiased dice rolled in public.
- â€Wallet popâ€upâ€? You approve actions (like shuffling) so nothing happens without your permission.
- â€Leaderboardâ€? Wins and participation are tracked and can be viewed by anyone.
